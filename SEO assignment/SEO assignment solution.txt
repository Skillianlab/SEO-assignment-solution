\fs40 Ans: Meta tags provide important information about a web page's content to search engines and browsers. Here are some benefits of using meta tags:
\fs32 \

\fs40 \'a0
\fs32 \

\fs40 1. Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Meta tags, particularly the meta description and meta keywords tags, can help improve a webpage's visibility on search engine results pages (SERPs). They provide concise information about the page's content, helping search engines understand what the page is about and how it should be indexed.
\fs32 \

\fs40 \'a0
\fs32 \

\fs40 2. Improved Click-Through Rates (CTR): A well-crafted meta description can attract more clicks from users on SERPs by providing a compelling summary of the page's content, enticing them to visit the site.
\fs32 \

\fs40 \'a0
\fs32 \

\fs40 3. Page Customization: Meta tags allow you to customize how your page appears in search results and when shared on social media platforms. You can control the title, description, and image that accompany your page's link.
\fs32 \

\fs40 \'a0
\fs32 \

\fs40 4. Accessibility: Some meta tags, like the meta charset tag, help define the character encoding of the page, ensuring that special characters and symbols display correctly in different browsers.
\fs32 \

\fs40 \'a0
\fs32 \

\fs40 5. Browser Behaviour: Meta tags can influence how browsers render your page. For example, the meta viewport tag can control the initial zoom level and scaling of the page on mobile devices.
\fs32 \

\fs40 \'a0
\fs32 \

\fs40 6. Structured Data: Meta tags, such as Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags, enable you to provide structured data about your content, which can enhance the appearance of links when shared on social media.
\fs32 \

\fs40 \'a0
\fs32 \

\fs40 7. Analytics and Tracking: Some meta tags, like the meta refresh tag, can be used for automatic redirection, while others, like the meta robots tag, help control how search engines crawl and index your site.
\fs32 \

\fs40 \'a0
\fs32 \

\fs40 In summary, meta tags play a crucial role in optimizing your web pages for search engines, improving their appearance on SERPs and social media, enhancing user experience, and providing valuable information to browsers and web crawlers.

\fs42\fsmilli21333 Q5. Define Favicon and give an illustrative example.
\fs32  \
\'a0\

\fs40 Ans: A "favicon," short for "favourite icon," is a small, typically square image or icon that represents a website or web page. It is displayed in various places, such as the browser's address bar, bookmarks, tabs, and in some cases, alongside search results. Favicons help users identify and remember websites more easily.
\fs32 \

\fs40 \'a0
\fs32 \

\fs40 Illustrative Example:\uc0\u8232 \u8232 
\fs32 \

\fs40 Let's say you have a website for a Videogame called "VGWorld." You can create a favicon for this website, typically in a square format, and it could be a simple representation of a video games or a stylized \'93VGW" for VGworld
\fs32 \

\fs40 \'a0
\fs32 \

\fs40 Here's an example of how you might define a favicon in the HTML code of your webpage:
\fs32 \

\fs40 \'a0
\fs32 \

\fs40 html
\fs32 \

\fs40 <!DOCTYPE html>
\fs32 \

\fs40 <html>
\fs32 \

\fs40 <head>
\fs32 \

\fs40 \'a0\'a0\'a0 <meta charset="UTF-8">
\fs32 \

\fs40 \'a0\'a0\'a0 <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
\fs32 \

\fs40 \'a0\'a0\'a0 <title>VGworld - Your Favourite Video game store</title>
\fs32 \

\fs40 \'a0\'a0\'a0 <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="favicon.png">
\fs32 \

\fs40 </head>
\fs32 \

\fs40 <body>
\fs32 \

\fs40 \'a0\'a0\'a0 <!-- Your website content goes here -->
\fs32 \

\fs40 </body>
\fs32 \

\fs40 </html>
\fs32 \

\fs40 \'a0
\fs32 \

\fs40 \'a0
\fs32 \

\fs40 In this example, the `<link>` element with the `rel="icon"` attribute is used to specify the location of the favicon image, which is named "favicon.png" in this case. When a user visits your website, their browser will display this favicon in the browser's tab and address bar, making it easy for them to recognize your website among their open tabs and bookmarks.
